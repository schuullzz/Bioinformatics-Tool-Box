This program will read in a file containing a string of nucleotides. User has the option between transcription or translation. If transcription is selected a file will be read in and transcribed into mRNA (ouput file will be mRNA.txt). If translation is selected a file will be read in and translated into an amino acid chain (ouput file will be protein.txt).
